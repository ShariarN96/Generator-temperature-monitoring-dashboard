# 🔥 Generator Temperature Monitoring Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built in **Python** using **Dash** and **Plotly** to monitor and forecast generator temperatures. This tool provides an intuitive interface for engineers and analysts to explore temperature trends, adjust model parameters, and predict potential overheating or failure scenarios.

## 🧠 Methodology

To enable predictive insights, we first identified the most influential variables affecting generator temperature. Based on correlation analysis and domain understanding, we selected **ambient temperature** and **electrical current** as the two key input features.

The dashboard includes:
- 🎛️ Custom controls to adjust parameters
- 🗓️ A date range picker for filtered time-series analysis
- 📈 Real-time visual feedback through interactive plots

This allows users to simulate and explore temperature behavior under varying operational conditions.
