# ðŸ”¥ Generator Temperature Monitoring Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built in **Python** using **Dash** and **Plotly** to monitor and forecast generator temperatures. This tool provides an intuitive interface for engineers and analysts to explore temperature trends, adjust model parameters, and predict potential overheating or failure scenarios.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

To enable predictive insights, we first identified the most influential variables affecting generator temperature. Based on correlation analysis and domain understanding, we selected **ambient temperature** and **electrical current** as the two key input features.

The dashboard was then designed with:

- Custom controls to adjust these parameters
- A date range picker for filtered time-series analysis
- Real-time visual feedback through interactive plots

This structure allows users to simulate and explore temperature behavior under varying operational conditions.
